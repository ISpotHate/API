To add your own model to the code, first go to [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) to host the fastAPI endpoint.

Once the project is running locally (or hosted on your platform of choice), host your Machine Learning model on Huggingface. 

See the `is_hate_all()` function for an example of blending or ensembling your machine learning model into the API.
